///              hold timer. Nothing visible happens yet.
///   ≥ 400ms  → begin recording: show the capsule and start the transcriber.
///   Fn up    → if the hold never reached the threshold, do nothing: no recording
///              starts, so a quick Fn tap never flashes the capsule or spins up the
///              microphone. (The tap still suppresses the Fn event, but the
///              system's input-source switch happens below the event tap and is
///              unaffected — quick taps stay usable for switching input.)
///              Otherwise stop the transcriber, optionally refine the text via the
///              LLM ("Refining…"), then dismiss the capsule and inject the text.
///
/// The 400ms debounce is what makes a quick Fn tap a no-op for recording.
///
/// Privacy: this type never logs, prints, or persists transcribed text, audio,
/// keystrokes, or the API key. The transcript lives only in memory for the
